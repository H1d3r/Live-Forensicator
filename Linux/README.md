# ü§î ABOUT

Live Forensicator is part of the Black Widow Toolbox, its aim is to assist Forensic Investigators and Incidence responders in carrying out a quick live forensic investigation.
<p>It achieves this by gathering different system information for further review for anomalous behaviour or unexpected data entry, it also looks out for unusual files or activities and points it out to the investigator.</p>
<p>Forensicator for Linux offers a timeline feature for fetching Linux logs from different sources for a specified date and time. </p>
<p>It is paramount to note that this script has no inbuilt intelligence its left for the investigator to analyse the output and decide on a conclusion or decide on carrying out more deeper investigation.</p>


```bash

## üé´ Optional Dependencies

This script is written in bash for use on Linux PCs and Servers. 
For additional features it depends on external binaries, they are in the Forensicator-Share folder.
But Forensicator can work without these dependencies, they just help with additional features
```
```bash
avml     For taking RAM capture (https://github.com/microsoft/avml)
aqlite3  Aids in Browsing history extraction (https://sqlite.org/)
```

## üî® Usage

```bash
# copy the files to the computer
git clone https://github.com/Johnng007/Live-Forensicator.git

# change to the Linux Directory and Make script executable
cd Linux && chmod 777 Forensicator.sh

# Execution
.\Forensicator.sh <parameters>

```

## ü•ä Examples

```python
# Basic
.\Forensicator.sh

# Check Usage
.\Forensicator.sh -u, --usage

# Capture network traffic for 60 secounds
.\Forensicator.sh -p, pcap

# Check for files that has similar extensions with ransomware encrypted files (can take some time to complete)
.\Forensicator.sh -s, ransom

# Grab weblogs NGINX & Apache
.\Forensicator.sh -w, weblogs

# Extract logs based on a timeline (e.g --timeline 'startdate' 'enddate')(e.g --timeline '2024-06-01 00:00:00' '2024-06-07 23:59:59')
.\Forensicator.sh -t, --timeline

# Collect browsing history
.\Forensicator.sh -b, browser

# Define LogFiles to search through when using timeline
.\Forensicator.sh -log, logfiles (e.g --logfiles auth.log,syslog,kern.log)

# Define log directory to loop through when using timeline
.\Forensicator.sh -logdir, --logdir (e.g --outputdir /custom/log/directory)

# Extract RAM
.\Forensicator.sh -r, --ram

# Yes of course you can do all (Defining log files and directory is actually optional when using timeline.)
.\Forensicator.sh -p -s -w --timeline '2024-06-01 00:00:00' '2024-06-07 23:59:59'

# For Unattended Mode on Basic Usage
.\Forensicator.sh -name 'Ebuka John' -case 01123 -title 'Ransomware Infected Laptop' -loc Prague -device AZUZ

# You can use unattended mode for each of the other parameters
.\Forensicator.sh -name 'Ebuka John' -case 01123 -title 'Ransomware Infected Laptop' -loc Prague -device AZUZ -p -s -w

## ‚úç Notes
* Run the script as an administrator to get value.<br>

* Forensicator Activities may be flagged by IDS or IPS Solutions so take note.<br>
  The results are outputed in nice looking html files with an index file. <br>

* You can find all extracted Artifacts in the script's working directory.

* <p>Forensicator Has the ability to Search through all the folders within a system looking for files with similar extensions as well known Ransomwares, Albeit this     search takes long but its helpful if the Alert you recieved is related to a Ransomware attack, Use the -RANSOMWARE Parameter to invoke this.</p>

* <p>Forensictor can capture network traffic using netsh trace, this is useful when your investigation has to do with asset communicating with known malicious IPs,       this way you can parse the pcapng file to wireshark and examine for C&C servers. By Defult i set the capture to take 120secs</p>

* <p>Sometimes it may be paramount to maintain the integrity of the Artifacts, where lawyers may argue that it might have been compromised on transit to your lab.
  Forensicator can now encrypt the Artifact with a unique randomely generated key using AES algorithm, you can specify this by using the -ENCRYPTED parameter. You can   decrypt it at will anywhere anytime even with another copy of Forensicator, just keep your key safe. This task is performed by the FileCryptography.psm1 file</p>

* <p>Forensictor looks out for suspicious activities within the Event Log, it has a long list of malicious executables, and powershell commands which it queries the event log against.</p>
