# ü§î ABOUT

Live Forensicator is part of the Black Widow Toolbox, its aim is to assist Forensic Investigators and Incidence responders in carrying out a quick live forensic investigation.
<p>It achieves this by gathering different system information for further review for anomalous behaviour or unexpected data entry, it also looks out for unusual files or activities and points it out to the investigator.</p>
<p>It is paramount to note that these scripts have no inbuilt intelligence its left for the investigator to analyse the output and decide on a conclusion or decide on carrying out more deeper investigation.</p>

# üñ≥ WINDOWS
<p>The windows version of Forensicator is written in Powershell.</p>
<p> Forensicator analysis Event Logs, it querries the event logs for certain log IDs that might point to an unusual activity or compromise. </p>

> #### NOTE: 
> The Bash codes were written for cross compatibility so therefore efforts were made to use factory shipped commands and avoid secoundary utitlities like `net-tools`.



## ‚úç Notes
* Run the scripts as a priviledged user to get value.<br>

* Forensicator Activities may be flagged by IDS or IPS Solutions so take note.<br>
  The results are outputed in nice looking html files with an index file. <br>

* You can find all extracted Artifacts in the script's working directory.

* <p>Forensicator Has the ability to Search through all the folders within a system looking for files with similar extensions as well known Ransomwares, Albeit this     search takes long but its helpful if the Alert you recieved is related to a Ransomware attack</p>

* <p>Forensictor can capture network traffic using netsh trace, this is useful when your investigation has to do with asset communicating with known malicious IPs,       this way you can parse the pcapng file to wireshark and examine for C&C servers. By Defult i set the capture to take 120secs</p>

* <p>Sometimes it may be paramount to maintain the integrity of the Artifacts, where lawyers may argue that it might have been compromised on transit to your lab.
  Forensicator can now encrypt the Artifact with a unique randomely generated key using AES algorithm, you can specify this by using the -ENCRYPTED parameter. You can   decrypt it at will anywhere anytime even with another copy of Forensicator, just keep your key safe. This task is performed by the FileCryptography.psm1 file
> #### NOTE: 
> This feature is only currently available in the Windows Module..
</p>

* <p>In the Windows module Forensictor looks out for suspicious activities within the Event Log, it has a long list of malicious executables, and powershell commands which it queries the event log against.</p>
